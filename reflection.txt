Game Description

This game is heavily based off of Cool Math Game's Hill Climb Racing. The game is simple,
travel as far as you can in a physics based jeep before you run out of gas. The game also ends if you flip your car and kill the driver. 

Controls:
A to move backwards
B to move forwards

Character behavior:
The driver in the car has a physics based head that bobbles back and fourth for your own entertainment.

Challenges:
The most challenging part of the game was the terrain generation. This is because I used an algorithm called Perlin noise and went through many failed attempts before I was able to make it work. The terrain generation also involved using a closed shape sprite object which I was unfamiliar with.

Time to Complete:
